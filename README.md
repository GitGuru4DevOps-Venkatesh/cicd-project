**Creating a fully functional project involves numerous steps, and providing all the code for each step would be quite extensive. However, I can give you an outline of the steps you need to take along with some code snippets to guide you. Please note that you'll need to adapt the code to fit your specific requirements.**

**1. Set Up AWS Account:**
   - Create an AWS account if you don't have one.
   - Set up AWS CLI and configure it with your credentials.

**2. Create an S3 Bucket:**
   - Create an S3 bucket to store uploaded images.

**3. Frontend Development:**
   - Use a modern frontend framework (e.g., React). Create a form to allow users to upload images.
   - Use the AWS Amplify library for React to simplify interactions with AWS services.

   ```jsx
   // Example React component for image upload form
   import { Storage } from 'aws-amplify';

   const ImageUploadForm = () => {
     const handleFileChange = async (event) => {
       const file = event.target.files[0];
       await Storage.put(file.name, file);
       // Trigger backend processing here
     };

     return (
       <div>
         <input type="file" onChange={handleFileChange} />
       </div>
     );
   };
   ```

**4. Backend Development with Serverless and AWS Lambda:**
   - Create an AWS Lambda function to handle image uploads and trigger image analysis using Amazon Rekognition.

   ```javascript
   // Example Lambda function to process image upload
   const AWS = require('aws-sdk');

   const rekognition = new AWS.Rekognition();

   exports.handler = async (event) => {
     const bucket = event.Records[0].s3.bucket.name;
     const key = event.Records[0].s3.object.key;

     const params = {
       Image: {
         S3Object: {
           Bucket: bucket,
           Name: key,
         },
       },
     };

     const result = await rekognition.detectLabels(params).promise();
     // Process labels and return results
     return {
       statusCode: 200,
       body: JSON.stringify(result.Labels),
     };
   };
   ```

**5. Dockerize the Backend:**
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for your Lambda function.

   ```Dockerfile
   FROM public.ecr.aws/lambda/nodejs:14

   COPY index.js /var/task/
   COPY node_modules /var/task/node_modules
   ```

**6. Set Up AWS ECS for Docker Deployment:**
   - Use ECS to deploy your Dockerized Lambda function at scale.

**7. Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement AWS Cognito for user authentication and authorization.

**8. CI/CD Pipeline:**
   - Set up a CI/CD pipeline using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild.

**9. Frontend Integration with Backend:**
   - Connect your frontend to the backend using API Gateway or directly invoke Lambda functions.

**10. Testing and Debugging:**
   - Test your application thoroughly, both locally and in the AWS environment.
   - Use AWS CloudWatch for logging and monitoring.

This is a high-level overview, and the actual implementation may vary based on your specific requirements and technology choices. Ensure you follow best practices for security, scalability, and maintainability throughout the development process.
